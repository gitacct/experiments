i lit out from Compton.
i was trailed by fourty hounds.
i didn't get to sleep last night until the twilight came around.
set out walkin' but i take my time.
a friend of the satan is a friend of mine.
if i get to hell before daylight
i just might get some sleep tonight.
ran into satan
he loaned me counterfeit bills
i spent the night in Missouri
in a cave up the hills
set out walkin' but i take my time
a friend of the satan is a friend of mine
if i get to hell before daylight
i just might get some sleep tonight
i ran down to the hell's gate
but the devil caught me there
he took my fake dollar bills
and vanished in the air
i set out walkin' but i take my time
a friend of the devil is a friend of mine
if i get to hell before daylight
i just might get some sleep tonight
got two reasons why i stay awake each lonely night
the first one's named Sweet Nancy,
and she's my hearts delight.
the second one is prison baby
the sheriff's on my trail
and if he catches up with me
i'll spend my life in jail.
got a wife in Chino baby,
and one in Cherokee
the first one says she's got my child
but it don't look like me
set out walkin' but i take my time
a friend of the beelzebub is a friend of mine
if i get to hell before daylight
i just might get some sleep tonight
got two reasons why i stay awake each lonely night,
the first one's named Sweet Nancy,
and she's my hearts delight,
the second one is prison, baby
the sheriff's on my trail,
and if he catches up with me,
i'll spend my life in jail.
they say i got a wife in Chino baby
i've got one in Cherokee
the first one says she's got my child
but it does not look like me
set out walkin' but i take my time
a friend of the devil is a friend of mine
if i get to hellbefore daylight
just might get some sleep tonight'
