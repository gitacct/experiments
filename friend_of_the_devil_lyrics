i lit out from Reno.
i was trailed by twenty hounds.
i didn't get to sleep last night until the morning came around.
set out runnin' but i take my time.
a friend of the devil is a friend of mine.
if i get home before daylight
i just might get some sleep tonight.
ran into the devil
he loaned me twenty bills
i spent the night in Utah
in a cave up the hills
set out runnin' but i take my time
a friend of the devil is a friend of mine
if i get home before daylight
i just might get some sleep tonight
i ran down to the levee
but the devil caught me there
he took my twenty dollar bill
and vanished in the air
i set out runnin' but i take my time
a friend of the devil is a friend of mine
if i get home before daylight
i just might get some sleep tonight
got two reasons why i cry away each lonely night
the first one's named Sweet Anne Marie,
and she's my hearts delight.
the second one is prison baby
the sheriff's on my trail
and if he catches up with me
i'll spend my life in jail.
got a wife in Chino baby,
and one in Cherokee
the first one says she's got my child
but it don't look like me
set out runnin' but i take my time
a friend of the devil is a friend of mine
if i get home before daylight
i just might get some sleep tonight
got two reasons why i cry away each lonely night,
the first one's named Sweet Anne Marie,
and she's my hearts delight,
the second one is prison, baby
the sheriff's on my trail,
and if he catches up with me,
i'll spend my life in jail.
they say i got a wife in Chino baby
i've got one in Cherokee
the first one says she's got my child
but it does not look like me
set out runnin' but i take my time
a friend of the devil is a friend of mine
if i get home before daylight
just might get some sleep tonight'
